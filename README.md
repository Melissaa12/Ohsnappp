<H1>Description </H1>
<br> <b>Problem Statement:</b> Improving cohort based learning through a fully integrated photo application to capture vital information on the whiteboard or screen. 
<br> <b>Main Idea:</b> Establish an automated camera system that will be able to capture vital lesson contents. Students can send instruction to take pictures through a Telegram bot whilst teachers and admins can use the kivy app to adjust camera position. The Kivy app has a log in interface to prevent misuse by students.
